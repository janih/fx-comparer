# FXComparer #
FXComparer is an application which lets the user select two archives and compare them either by selecting the archive using a "file-chooser" or by "drag & drop" a file into the application. The result of the compare is presented in an easy to read table and instant feedback of the differences in the archives are presented for the users.

This application was created to honor a old jar named jarcomparer.jar.
